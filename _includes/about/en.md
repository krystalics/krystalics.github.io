**The Light of Dawn**

​                                                                                                          

We read poems in our hearts.

We write verse of our own life.

Interconnected with each other,

In crying our lives are brightened by zeal and ardor.

Fire is burning out our last moments of youth in this bewildering world，

As the footprints will be covered at last in this vast snowfield.

Seeing, hearing and facing the last holiness in the dawn,

We are finally transformed to mild wind and fine dust.

 

I want to be as tough as a mountain.

I want to be as brave as a soldier.

I want to seize the light and control my life.

But I lost myself under the darkness.

 

Oh Captain, my Captain!

Please point a way to free my soul.

Don't mind the eyes of the world.

Color of the old photos has faded,

Leaving motley shadows only.

But faith will not fall down.

Its seeds are sprouting with hopes，

Waiting for a new Samsara.
