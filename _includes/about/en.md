**The Light of Dawn**

​                                                                                                          

We read poems in our hearts.

We write verse of our own life.

Interconnected with each other,

In crying our lives are brightened by zeal and ardor.

Fire is burning out our last moments of youth in this bewildering world，

As the footprints will be covered at last in this vast snowfield.

Seeing, hearing and facing the last holiness in the dawn,

We are finally transformed to mild wind and fine dust.

 

I want to be as tough as a mountain.

I want to be as brave as a soldier.

I want to seize the light and control my life.

But I lost myself under the darkness.

 

Oh Captain, my Captain!

Please point a way to free my soul.

Don't mind the eyes of the world.

Color of the old photos has faded,

Leaving motley shadows only.

But faith will not fall down.

Its seeds are sprouting with hopes，

Waiting for a new Samsara.

 

 

 

 

 

**晨光熹微**

 

读诗，悲欢他人的悲欢

写诗，刻下人生的轨迹

人类互相交织的热情

在哭泣中点燃了生命之火

浊世的火焰在疯狂的燃烧着最后的青春

就像在雪地里留下的脚印最终被抹去

看见，听见，遇见那最后的圣洁与黎明

化成微风与尘埃

 

不是我不想要坚强

不是我天生懦弱

我想要抓住我生命的光亮

可我在黑暗中失去了自我

 

指引者

请告诉我该去的方向

请不要在意世人的目光

就像那些色彩褪去的老照片

现在就只有斑驳的旧影

心中的信仰永不会倒塌

希望的种子已经发出了芽

请等待下一个轮回
